Implement Euler's Method: Develop a Python script to solve initial-value problems (IVPs) using Euler's Method. This involves creating a function that returns arrays of t values and approximate solutions w for the given differential equation y′=f(t,y).

Test and Compare Solutions: Test the implemented Euler's Method on a specific IVP y'=y−t^2+1 with given initial conditions. Compare the approximate solutions with the exact solutions and visualize the results using graphs.

Solve Additional Problems: Modify the function definitions and initial conditions to solve additional problems from the textbook. Save the graphs of the approximate solutions for each problem.

Analyze Step Size Effects: Use the code to solve another IVP y′=e^t cos(t) with different step sizes (h=0.25, h=0.1, and h=0.01). Analyze the effect of step size on the accuracy of the solutions and discuss the results.

Report Writing: Document the process and results in a LaTeX report.

This project aims to provide hands-on experience with Euler's Method for solving differential equations, enhance understanding of numerical methods, and improve skills in programming, error analysis, and technical reporting.
